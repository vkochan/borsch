It is a messy draft project with merging of code from dvtm, vis (text core),
and adding a Chez Scheme for customization.

## Purpose

Create Emacs-like development environment with Scheme.

## License

borsch reuses some code of dvtm and is released under the same
[MIT/X11 license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martanne/dvtm/master/LICENSE).
The terminal emulation part is licensed under the ISC license.

## WARNING

Project is just a hobby and things may change radically (including Scheme API).
